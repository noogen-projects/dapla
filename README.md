# Laplace

The local-first web-application platform for the decentralized web.

Look at the traditional centralized web-applications architecture vs. the local-first web-applications architecture:

The Laplace high-level architecture is shown in the diagram below:

## Build

Building Laplace requires the latest `stable` and `nightly` Rust toolchains, the `wasm32` targets and `cargo-make` and
`wasm-bindgen` build tools.

To install Rust and its toolchains/targets via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), if it is not already installed, run:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

rustup toolchain install stable nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable
rustup target add wasm32-wasi --toolchain nightly
```

To install [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) and
[wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), run:

```shell
cargo install --force cargo-make wasm-bindgen-cli
```

To build Laplace and all examples, run:

```shell
cargo make all
```

Or for a debug build, use the following command:

```shell
cargo make -p debug all
```

## Run examples

Run the Laplace server:

```shell
cargo make run
```

Or for a debug build:

```shell
cargo make -p debug run
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). If you are running for the first time or the previous link
did not work, then visit [http://localhost:8080/?access_token=24tpHRcbGKGYFGMYq66G3hfH8GQEYGTysXqiJyaCy9eR](http://localhost:8080/?access_token=24tpHRcbGKGYFGMYq66G3hfH8GQEYGTysXqiJyaCy9eR).
You can change the default port, access token and other settings by editing `Laplace.toml` config file.
